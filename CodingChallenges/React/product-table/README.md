## Product Table

This project is an implementation of the [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) page.

The props and the state are implemented in a create-react-app.

Several components have been built : 

- FilterableProductTable: contains the entirety of the example
- SearchBar: receives all user input
- ProductTable: displays and filters the data collection based on user input
- ProductCategoryRow: displays a heading for each category
- ProductRow: displays a row for each product
